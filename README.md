`hypercurve` is the planar curved-topology crate for the Hyper geometry stack. It owns
line, circular-arc, polynomial Bezier, rational-conic, contour, region,
boolean-boundary, offset, fitting, flattening, and prepared-query surfaces over
`hyperreal::Real` values. Its geometry is strictly 2D; spatial curves and their
3D parameterizations belong to `hyperbrep`.

The crate provides exact mixed-family curve/path intersection and regularized region
Booleans for its supported topology. Unsupported implicit branch correspondence and
free-form offset trimming remain typed blockers instead of being hidden by display
polylines.

## Core API

`CurveRegion2` is the exact mixed-family region type. It accepts closed `CurvePath2`
boundaries containing any public curve family and preserves exact source, path, curve,
promoted-span, split-range, operand, and reversal provenance on every emitted fragment.
It classifies points directly against native polynomial/rational boundaries with
even-odd fill semantics, retaining native loop, decided AABB, and exact signed-area
facts across clones. Exact line-image algebraic carriers are lowered once to a
clone-shared native line region; nonlinear algebraic carriers filter exact source-curve
incidence to their represented parameter ranges. Only non-line carriers lacking retained
source-curve provenance remain explicit classification blockers.
`CurvePath2::boolean_region` computes a one-shot union, intersection, difference, or
XOR. `PreparedCurvePathIntersection2::boolean_region_view` caches and borrows each
operation/side-policy result when the same path pair is queried repeatedly.
`CurveRegion2::boolean_region` accepts those retained results directly, including
nonlinear algebraic endpoint carriers, nested holes, and prior Boolean output.
`CurveRegion2::try_prepare_boolean` returns a `PreparedCurveRegionBoolean2` that
computes each cross-region carrier intersection once and clone-shares the four lazy
regularized results. Region preparation retains certified loop-junction vertex
identity, so independently represented algebraic endpoint images are not reclassified
when a result feeds another operation.

`CurveRegion2` is the sole general owned region carrier. Native line/circular-arc
topology is retained internally as a specialized accelerator; borrowed native
contour views and prepared views serve repeated classification and Boolean queries
without copying contours. `Contour2` owns a closed line/arc boundary, while
`CurveString2` owns an open or closed ordered line/arc path.

`Curve2` is the immutable shared carrier for lines, circular arcs, quadratic and
cubic Beziers, arbitrary-degree rational Beziers, polynomial B-splines, and NURBS.
`CurveView2<'_>` and `CurvePathView2<'_>` provide borrowed traversal without
copying geometry. `CurveParameterDomain2` gives every family a uniform exact
public domain: native curves use `[0, 1]`, while splines retain `[U[p], U[n+1]]`.
`PolynomialSplineCurve2` and `NurbsCurve2` accept exact controls, weights, and
knots without a runtime policy, support clamped and non-clamped finite active
domains plus explicit periodic one-period carriers, retain optional `CurveSource2`
provenance, and share exact Bezier
decompositions across clones. Their borrowed span views preserve source identity,
source span index, and knot interval through topology promotion. Exact point and
derivative evaluation accepts explicit left/right knot-side selection; automatic
selection certifies that both sides agree. `ExactCurveError` reports the operation,
curve family, source version, and blocking predicate or invariant. Curves and
connected paths reverse or undergo exact planar similarity transforms without
changing their public parameter domains, families, or provenance. `Curve2::split_at`
and `Curve2::subcurve` dispatch exact trimming across every family while retaining
family and provenance; spline results also retain their selected authored domains.
`CurvePath2::chamfer_vertex_by_parameters` and
`CurvePath2::fillet_vertex_by_parameters` apply that exact trimming uniformly to
mixed-family vertices. They accept each curve's native `Real` parameter domain,
support the start/end seam of closed paths, preserve source family and provenance,
and certify fillet radius, tangency, and traversal direction before inserting a
native line or circular arc. Edited closed paths remain valid inputs to
`CurveRegion2::try_from_boundary_paths`.
Circular arcs promote exactly to one or more rational quadratic spans, including
minor, semicircular, major, and full-circle sweeps, and share that promotion
across top-level curve clones.

Pipeline reports, finite projection, reconstruction, and IO are secondary APIs.
`CurveRegion2::arrange_unordered_segments` and its borrowed variant return a
retained `CurveRegionArrangement2`; native arrangement machinery and caches stay
behind that unified result so callers do not manage workspaces or duplicate a
second owned region representation.

`CurveRegion2::segment_certified` emits a line-only unified region whose vertices
remain exact `Real` values, with per-loop role, fill-rule, source-span, subdivision,
and chord-error evidence. `segment_to_finite_profiles` is the explicit `f64`
mesh/extrusion boundary; `recover_from_finite_profiles_with_report` mirrors that
boundary by rebuilding exact-scalar line/arc topology while recording that the
relationship to the original curves is lossy.

Polynomial Bezier parallels retain the exact analytic expression and exact source/
offset-cusp isolation. Line images and Pythagorean-hodograph curves materialize exact
native or rational offsets. Other regular spans use Levien-style cubics and Blend2D
quadratics only as candidates; a conservative exact-scalar verifier certifies each
accepted span. `CurvePath2::approximate_parallel_blend2d_certified` assembles smooth
connected paths, while `CurveRegion2::offset_with_certified_bezier_parallel` adds
output chord certification and exact line-arrangement regularization. Its report
distinguishes the pre-regularization directed error bound, final-topology guarantees,
and the weaker source-chord fallback used for corners or unsupported families.

`Contour2::straight_skeleton` implements an exact inward wavefront for simple,
strictly convex line contours. Unit-normal support lines, vertex trajectories,
edge-collapse times, simultaneous events, terminal ridges, and source-edge
provenance remain exact `Real` evidence in the returned graph. Concave contours
return a typed `SplitEventsRequired` blocker until their reflex-vertex split-event
scheduler is available; they are never substituted with centroid rays.

`translation_obstacle_convex` constructs the exact closed no-fit region
`fixed + (-moving)` for simple convex line contours. It normalizes orientation,
removes exact collinear vertices, and merges ordered edge directions in linear
output work. Concave inputs return a typed convex-decomposition blocker.

## Typical Curve Problems

Curved planar geometry combines robust-predicate failures with representation failures:
tangent contacts, overlapping arcs, nearly coincident boundaries, Bezier roots, offset
self-intersections, and lossy chordization. Fixed epsilons can make one fixture pass and
the next fail; eager exact algebra can also expand before broad-phase filters eliminate
obvious misses.

`hypercurve` stages the work. Native curve objects keep exact control structure,
prepared views and boxes reduce candidate sets, low-degree exact cases are promoted
when available, and unresolved tangent, overlap, root-isolation, trimming, or topology
cases remain explicit uncertainty instead of being hidden behind display polylines.

## Main Types

- `CurveRegion2` is the exact mixed-family owned region type. `RegionView2` and
  native-contour views are borrowed acceleration/interchange adapters for exact
  line/arc topology.
- `Curve2`, `CurveView2`, `CurvePath2`, and `CurvePathView2` are the primary
  mixed-family curve and connected-path types.
- `PreparedCurveIntersection2` dispatches top-level curve pairs through retained
  native spans, uses exact circle predicates before generic rational resultants,
  deduplicates spline-knot contacts, and reports exact source/span/parameter provenance
  plus unresolved pair evidence. Trimmed and reversed curves distinguish their current
  public parameter ranges from retained root-source ranges, and represented contacts
  expose both values. Complete reports lazily retain contact-derived span
  splits and arrangements.
- `PreparedCurvePathIntersection2` computes authored curve-pair facts once and lazily
  retains aggregate contacts, overlaps, split topology, regularized Boolean selection,
  arrangement traversal, and `CurveRegion2` output for each operation and declared
  boundary-interior side. `CurvePath2::boolean_region` is the direct one-shot entry.
- `PreparedCurveRegionBoolean2` performs the corresponding operation on retained
  `CurveRegion2` values, reuses exact carrier-pair reports across all four operations,
  and preserves algebraic fragment intervals and parent source provenance in chained
  results.
- `Contour2`, `CurveString2`, `Point2`, `LineSeg2`, `CircularArc2`, and `Segment2`
  provide boundary and primitive geometry. `CircularArc2::sweep_fraction` and
  `point_at_sweep_fraction` are exact inverse directed-angular operations for minor,
  major, semicircular, and full-circle arcs; `rational_bezier_decomposition` exposes
  the separate retained piecewise-conic parameterization. `CurveString2` parameter
  trims use affine line fractions and directed-angular arc fractions and retain the
  exact evaluated endpoint witnesses. `CurveString2::chamfer_vertex_by_parameters`
  and its point-bearing counterpart use those same conventions for line-line,
  line-arc, arc-line, and arc-arc vertices; source segments retain their native
  families and exact source-range reports around the inserted line bevel.
  `CurveString2::fillet_vertex_by_parameters` and its point-bearing counterpart
  likewise certify exact source/fillet tangency for every native line/arc pairing,
  preserve trimmed source families, and retain inverse arc-parameter witnesses so
  parameter-driven edits replay the original exact points across clones.
  The corresponding `CurvePath2` parameter APIs cover line, circular-arc,
  quadratic/cubic Bezier, rational quadratic/general Bezier, polynomial B-spline,
  and NURBS pairings, including closed-path seam vertices. Point-bearing APIs stay
  on the native line/arc carrier because general algebraic point inversion is not
  silently approximated.
- `QuadraticBezier2`, `CubicBezier2`, `RationalQuadraticBezier2`, and their fact,
  relation, metric, zero-error fitting, exact-parallel/cusp, PH-offset,
  conservatively verified fitting, staged offset, and flattening APIs represent
  polynomial and rational curve work.
- `BezierParameterPolynomial` isolates represented and algebraic roots in `[0, 1]`;
  `BezierRootIsolationResult2` and `BezierRootIsolationTrace2` expose the ordered
  exact carriers and certificate-work counts for profiling root-heavy operations.
- `PolynomialSplineCurve2` and `NurbsCurve2` retain exact spline geometry, source
  provenance, exact active-domain point and one-sided/certified arbitrary-order
  derivative evaluation, exact knot insertion, splitting, subcurve extraction,
  traversal reversal, shared Bezier decomposition, and zero-allocation
  provenance-bearing span iteration. Periodic constructors accept one period of
  controls and knot breaks, retain the exact period, and provide certified wrapped
  point and derivative evaluation without repeated period stepping.
- `CurveParameterDomain2` and `CurveParameterSide2` provide family-independent
  parameter-domain and knot-side semantics. `Similarity2` transforms every
  top-level curve family and connected path without changing its family or source;
  top-level splitting and subcurve extraction dispatch through the same exact native
  and spline algorithms.
- `Aabb2`, prepared line/arc/curve-string/contour/region views, and segment/region fact
  types preserve repeated-query structure.
- Boolean, event, fragment, split, and boundary-loop types describe staged region
  boolean assembly.
- `ExactCurveError`, `ExactCurveBlocker`, `CurveFamily2`, and `CurveSource2` provide
  contextual exact-operation errors and provenance.
- Finite projection, reconstruction, bulge, and display/certified polyline types define
  IO and display boundaries.

## Precision Model

Native geometry uses `Real` coordinates. Primitive floats appear only in named finite
projection, reconstruction, test, benchmark, rendering, or IO helpers. Bulge imports,
flattened polylines, display offsets, and finite projections use explicit types so
callers can tell whether they are using topology evidence or display geometry.

The crate promotes exact low-degree evidence where it can: line/arc relations, selected
Bezier roots, retained intersection-region shape/refinement/isolation facts, monotone
graph ordering, exact area and moment contributions, length intervals, zero-error
line/arc and Bezier/conic primitive-fit evidence, exact Bezier area/moment
prefix sums for repeated path-range queries, exact-parameter Bezier/conic
split materialization, and retained branch-free Bezier/conic arrangement
traversal with exact tangent-ordered successor selection for simple branch
vertices. Closed retained traversals can materialize native Bezier/conic
boundary regions; polynomial Bezier loops and supported rational conics expose
exact Green-integral signed area. Algebraic split boundaries retain exact point,
tangent, and higher-order endpoint images when construction is certified instead
of being rounded into native coordinates. Algebraic carriers reverse without
demoting their source evidence: endpoint order is swapped, odd derivatives are
negated, even derivatives are preserved, and exact source boundaries are replayed
once and reused. Exact partial collinear, same-circle circular-arc, and
injectively parameterized nonlinear Bezier overlaps retain both source parameter
ranges, split only at overlap endpoints, and apply operation-aware ownership
only to the shared fragments. Exact subdivisions of the same certified-injective
rational Bezier retain their common source interval, so partial overlaps recover
represented local endpoints such as `1/3` directly and bypass resultants even
when point-incidence isolation would otherwise return an algebraic carrier.
For independently constructed curves, exact-rational polynomial coefficients use
the rational-root denominator bound plus isolator refinement and continued-fraction
reconstruction; candidates such as `1/3` are promoted only after exact replay.
Certified injective line images additionally retain irrational algebraic overlap
endpoints in `BezierParameterRange2`; those boundaries flow through top-level
splitting, path ownership, retained traversal, and region materialization without
scalar demotion. Exact polynomial graph certificates extend the same behavior to
curved nonlinear overlaps with independently parameterized irrational endpoints.
Cases that require multivalued implicit branch correspondence, bounded higher-order
fit, or offset trimming return unresolved regions, exact bisection or target-width
isolation results, or explicit uncertainty.

## Performance Model

`hypercurve` avoids numerical explosion by keeping curve objects native and using
structure before generic algebra. Bounding boxes, segment kind, endpoint equality,
monotone spans, material/hole role, prepared views, low-degree dispatch, dyadic
candidate promotion, and source metadata all reduce the number of exact predicates and
root checks.

Prepared curve-string, contour, and region views cache conservative boxes and predicate
handles for repeated containment, self-contact, event, and Boolean-boundary queries.
Prepared mixed-family path pairs use clone-shared exact curve bounds as a conservative
broad phase: only certified AABB misses are removed, and authored versus retained
candidate-pair counts remain observable. When two candidate boxes intersect at one
certified point and that point is an exact endpoint of both curves, endpoint topology
is retained directly without constructing a generic resultant.
Top-level spline clones share successful decompositions, promoted rational evaluators,
and contextual blockers. Top-level derivative dispatch reuses those spline-owned facts
instead of constructing a duplicate `Curve2` evaluator cache.
Single-span polynomial `Curve2` trims retain a positive source-injectivity certificate
and exact root parameter ranges. Related trimmed pairs reuse that fact for partial
overlap dispatch, including reversed ranges, instead of rebuilding resultants.
General rational Bezier clones also share lazily constructed homogeneous control-net,
power-basis, coordinate-derivative numerator, and decided axis-monotonicity facts
across evaluation, subdivision, derivative, incidence, and overlap predicates. Exact
point, derivative-batch, bounds, monotonicity, incidence, candidate, contact, and
overlap queries expose `ExactCurveResult`, preserving operation, curve-family, and
predicate-blocker context instead of leaking an ambiguous public classification.
Exact
subdivisions additionally retain
their source-parameter lineage and a positive source-injectivity certificate, allowing
related partial-overlap pairs to skip resultant construction. Prepared rational-Bezier pairs retain resultant projections, exact paired
contact replay, contact-derived split topology, and lazily assembled arrangements across
clones. Top-level prepared curve pairs retain every promoted span-pair dispatch and share
their provenance-bearing report. Native arc dispatch computes exact circle witnesses,
recovers represented rational-span parameters by projective inversion, and avoids
irrelevant span-pair resultants. Curved Boolean arrangements retain certified contact
vertex identities, so traversal reuses proven connectivity rather than comparing
independently expanded radical coordinates. Borrowed fact views avoid copying algebraic
evidence on repeated queries.
Prepared curved-region pairs additionally seed each retained loop junction as a known
topology vertex, merge new contacts into those identities, and split only the carriers
whose source intervals contain a contact. Each operation result is retained separately,
while source-curve intersection reports remain shared by the pair.
Degree-aligned shared-component replay elevates only the lower-degree homogeneous
Bernstein control net and reuses retained elevations, so independently rebuilt exact
degree elevations do not fall through to an unresolved resultant. Benchmarks track raw
and retained spline decomposition, cached general-rational evaluation, path-pair
preparation/candidate filtering, and ordinary, prepared, and mixed-prepared paths.

The complete reference-to-implementation audit, retained benchmark results, and
rejected optimization experiments are recorded in [PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md).
Cross-crate release benchmarks against `cavalier_contours`, `curvo`, `i_overlay`, and
`geo`, including equivalent-workload and numeric-model caveats, are documented in
[COMPARATIVE_BENCHMARKS.md](COMPARATIVE_BENCHMARKS.md).
Runtime exact-computation paths can be audited with
`cargo bench --features dispatch-trace --bench dispatch_trace`; the matching
feature-gated integration test verifies that public curve queries continue to
emit correlated trace evidence.
Adapter and authoring surfaces have a separate
`cargo bench --features triangulation --bench api_surface` lane.

  derivatives of arbitrary order, explicit left/right handling for points and
  derivatives at discontinuous knots, exact subdivision and subcurve extraction,
  exact traversal reversal, one-pass clone-shared batch knot refinement, exact
  proof-bearing knot removal by homogeneous inverse insertion, bounded retention of

  knots by certified inverse insertion to preserve the source continuity order;
- explicit nonuniform periodic polynomial B-spline and NURBS construction from one
  period of controls and knot breaks, exact cyclic carrier expansion, certified seam
  closure, arbitrary exact parameter wrapping, side-aware seam derivatives, and

  path, preserving family, parameter domain, connectivity, and source provenance;
- exact SVG path-boundary materialization for absolute/relative line, quadratic,
  smooth-quadratic, cubic, smooth-cubic, and circular-arc commands into `CurvePath2`,
  including radical circular centers, major-sweep selection, SVG radius correction,
  retained source/version reports, exact polynomial path export, and explicit refusal
  to approximate SVG-inexpressible rational or higher-order families;
- intersection surfaces for line/line, line/arc, arc/arc, Bezier contact cases, curve
  strings, contours, regions, and prepared repeated-query views, including top-level
  native line/line, line/arc, and arc/arc dispatch with exact contact provenance
  and retained blockers, certified same/reversed full-image overlap orientation
  plus partial collinear and same-circle arc overlap ranges, algebraic parameter
  ranges for certified injective line-image and polynomial-graph overlaps, represented exact

  prepared all-curve path-pair replay, aggregate path splitting, lazy arrangement assembly,
  operation-aware shared-span ownership from explicit boundary interior sides, exact
  representative-point classification, retained contact-vertex traversal, and
  union/intersection/difference/XOR region materialization for supported split topology,
  including exact algebraic-fragment reversal, endpoint-touching root-isolator
  refinement, composable retained-region Booleans, nested-hole ownership, and cached
  repeated region-pair operations; chained retained regions sharing one source
  parameterization clip full-component overlap reports to their exact algebraic carrier
  intervals before ownership classification;
- signed area, area moment, length interval, flattening, and zero-error primitive
  fitting for Bezier/conic line and point images;
- staged Bezier/conic offset candidates that construct exact line-image offsets and
  leave free-form offsets unresolved until certified trimming/fitting exists;
- primitive line/arc offsets, checked offsets, cap styles, region event/fragment
  extraction, boolean-boundary assembly, retained exact unordered line/arc
  arrangement construction with source/split/endpoint/ring/role/output caches,
  and conservative unresolved states.
- exact convex-polygon straight-skeleton wavefront construction with simultaneous
  edge-collapse events, terminal ridges, and explicit concave split-event blockers.

Known limits: shared components requiring multivalued implicit branch correspondence,
source curves with neither certified source lineage nor an injective graph axis, generic
resultants whose scalar signs remain uncertified, and offset self-intersection trimming
remain explicit blockers. Algebraically isolated split parameters are retained through
top-level path Booleans when a certified line image or polynomial graph supplies the
branch correspondence. Chained regions consume shared components whose overlap range is
contained by both retained carriers; clipping a shared component at a carrier boundary
is exact when retained identity-parameter evidence certifies the correspondence. A
carrier boundary under an independently parameterized shared component whose parameter
correspondence is not yet certified remains an `Unsupported` blocker.

## Installation

```toml
[dependencies]
hypercurve = "0.3.0"
```

For sibling checkouts:

```toml
[dependencies]
hypercurve = { path = "../hypercurve" }
```

Feature summary:

- `predicates`: default feature enabling `hyperlimit` predicate integration.
- `serde`: enables serialization for public records that support it.

## Usage

The native API uses `hyperreal::Real` coordinates:

```rust
use hypercurve::{CurvePolicy, LineSeg2, Point2, Real};

fn main() -> hypercurve::CurveResult<()> {
    let segment = LineSeg2::try_new(
        Point2::new(Real::from(0), Real::from(0)),
        Point2::new(Real::from(1), Real::from(0)),
    )?;

    let side = segment.classify_point(
        &Point2::new(Real::from(0), Real::from(1)),
        &CurvePolicy::certified(),
    );

    assert!(matches!(side, hypercurve::Classification::Decided(_)));
    Ok(())
}
```

Use native curve objects for Bezier facts, contours, regions, and downstream
geometry work:

```rust
use hypercurve::{
    Contour2, CurvePolicy, CurveRegion2, LineSeg2, Point2, QuadraticBezier2, Segment2,
};
use hyperreal::Real;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let p = |x, y| Point2::new(Real::from(x), Real::from(y));
    let bezier = QuadraticBezier2::new(p(0, 0), p(1, 2), p(2, 0));
    let facts = bezier.structural_facts();
    assert_eq!(facts.degree, hypercurve::BezierDegree::Quadratic);

    let bottom = Segment2::Line(LineSeg2::try_new(p(0, 0), p(2, 0))?);
    let right = Segment2::Line(LineSeg2::try_new(p(2, 0), p(2, 2))?);
    let top = Segment2::Line(LineSeg2::try_new(p(2, 2), p(0, 2))?);
    let left = Segment2::Line(LineSeg2::try_new(p(0, 2), p(0, 0))?);
    let contour = Contour2::try_new(vec![bottom, right, top, left])?;
    let policy = CurvePolicy::certified();
    let region = CurveRegion2::try_from_native_material_contours(vec![contour], &policy)?;

    let location = region.classify_point(&p(1, 1), &policy)?;
    assert!(matches!(location, hypercurve::Classification::Decided(_)));
    Ok(())
}
```

For unordered exact line/arc input, arrange through `CurveRegion2` and read output
and blockers from the retained result. The runnable
[`arrangement_report`](examples/arrangement_report.rs) example demonstrates the
arrangement, classification, and reporting workflow.

`CurveRegionArrangement2` retains one canonical evaluation and optional unified
region without duplicating report-shaped state.

## Pathological memory benchmarks

`pathological_regions` builds sharded pairs of retained `CurveRegion2` values.
Every shard contains line, circular-arc, quadratic/cubic Bezier, rational
quadratic/general Bezier, polynomial B-spline, and NURBS carriers; it also
retains rational, primitive-dyadic, multi-limb, symbolic constant/root/log/trig,
and opaque-computable `Real` samples. Its mate is copied through an exact
3-4-5 rotation plus rational translation. The same shard also carries a
finite-polyline `CurveRegion2` projection so all four Boolean operations have a
decidable stress lane when a higher-order operation correctly reports an
unsupported or undecidable exact predicate.

The tier names describe measured release-build native resident-size ranges.
The benchmark prints both its calibrated estimate and Linux `VmRSS` delta.

```sh
# Approximately 100 MiB; runs construction, deep rotation, and all Booleans.
cargo bench --bench pathological_regions

# Run every approximately 100 MiB, 500 MiB, and 1 GiB input.
HYPERCURVE_PATHOLOGICAL_TIERS=all cargo bench --bench pathological_regions

# Select work, tiers, or a small integration-smoke cell count.
HYPERCURVE_PATHOLOGICAL_MODE=build HYPERCURVE_PATHOLOGICAL_TIERS=500mb \
  cargo bench --bench pathological_regions
HYPERCURVE_PATHOLOGICAL_CELL_LIMIT=1 cargo bench --bench pathological_regions
```

Cross-suite equivalents are common path samples represented in each peer
crate's native polygon carrier. They preserve the native tier's geometric cell
count, rather than padding the smaller floating-point carriers to the same byte
count:

```sh
HYPERCURVE_COMPARE_PATHOLOGICAL_TIERS=all HYPERCURVE_COMPARE_ITERS=1 \
  cargo bench --features comparative-benchmarks --bench comparative

# Isolate one named benchmark group for profiling.
HYPERCURVE_COMPARE_GROUP=star64 cargo bench --features comparative-benchmarks --bench comparative
```

## Hyper Ecosystem

`hypercurve` uses [hyperreal](https://github.com/timschmidt/hyperreal),
[hyperlimit](https://github.com/timschmidt/hyperlimit),
[hypersolve](https://github.com/timschmidt/hypersolve), and optionally
[hypertri](https://github.com/timschmidt/hypertri). It provides planar curve and
region topology to the other [Hyper geometry and engineering
crates](https://github.com/timschmidt?tab=repositories&q=hyper&type=source).
