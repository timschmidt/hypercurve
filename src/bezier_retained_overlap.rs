//! Exact overlap evidence for retained Bezier arrangement fragments.
//!
//! Full overlap-aware traversal needs exact artifacts that say which retained
//! fragments share positive-dimensional geometry before a loop walker decides
//! ownership.  This module provides the first such artifact for materialized
//! native Bezier/conic and general rational-Bezier fragments. It does not sample curves and it does not
//! guess traversal through an overlap.  Instead it replays existing exact
//! curve predicates and emits only certified whole-image, line-image, or
//! rational parameter-range overlap pairs.
//!
//! The boundary is intentionally conservative in the exact-geometric-
//! computation sense:  Same polynomial images are
//! certified with Bernstein degree-normalization identities from the Bernstein and de Casteljau curve model.  Separating overlap
//! classification from traversal follows the degenerate-intersection clipping
//! model: an overlap is a
//! first-class event, not an arbitrary successor choice.
