# Future work: exact-composition performance and S5–S7 consolidation

This file records the remaining directions from the 2026 API and machinery review: what is still open, the evidence behind each direction, and approaches that were measured and rejected, so they are not repeated.

The detailed chronological log, including commit hashes, timings and samples, is `exactcore-hyper-comparison/audits/hypercurve-api-review-2026-09-12/implementation.md`. The original review is `review.md` beside it.

## Current state

The exact-only principal API, the `CurveRegion2` migration, and S1 (`SelectedScalar2` dispatch) are complete. S6 is partly done; the remaining sites are listed below.

The ignored composition harness (`tests/hypercurve_composed_workloads.rs` and `tests/hypercurve_open_path_compositions.rs`) has 8 of 24 cases completing under a 300 s budget:

| Case | Time |
| --- | --- |
| `repeated_inward_miter` | 21 s |
| `beveled_rational_seed` | 56 s |
| `weighted_conic` | 61 s |
| `booleans_then_double` | 76 s |
| `bevel_then_round` | 107 s |
| `mixed_family` | 123 s |
| `mixed_cubic_arc` | 203 s |
| `nested_xor` | 290 s |

The other 15 still exceed the budget, and the hyperbola-pair stroke is a known stall. All of them stay `#[ignore]`d, because they run far above the suite's per-test scale.

Sample a stalled case with `gdb -p <pid> -batch -ex "thread apply all bt"` against the test binary. Run it directly, for example `target/release/deps/hypercurve_open_path_compositions-* <name> --ignored --exact`, rather than through `cargo test`. Take the PID from `ps`, not `pgrep -f`, which matches the calling shell.

## 1. Signing radical tower values without squared dense polynomials

**Where the stalls are.** Most remaining stalls end in `RecursiveQuadraticValue::sign` → `hypersolve::dense_two_positive_square_root_sum_sign`. This affects the two-root group (`filleted_union`, `wide_weighted`, the chamfered strokes) and the tail of `refilleting`.

**Why the rule is not the problem.** The recursive rule (sign of a + b√d from the signs of a, b and a² − b²d) is sound. Every leaf sign, though, goes through `dense_polynomial_tuple_sign` on a fully expanded tensor:
- coefficients reach about 25,000 bits;
- degrees reach 15–30 per axis;
- nonzero values then need about 2,000 bits of root refinement to separate, roughly the coefficient size, so the cost is coefficient growth, not geometry.

**Proposed design** (from a code-grounded planning pass): keep the recursive rule, and change only the leaves.
1. **Lazy leaves.** Represent a leaf as an expression DAG over the reduced inputs (r, f, g, p, s1, s2) instead of an expanded tensor.
2. **Interval step.** Evaluate the DAG by interval arithmetic over the shared `RecursiveQuadraticBaseField::source_box` refinement.
3. **Modular nonzero certificate.** Compute the leaf's norm modulo a few primes, directly from the inputs, reducing modulo the selected root's polynomial after each product. Use a good prime: leading coefficients and denominators must be units. If gcd(m mod p, N mod p) is 1, the leaf is nonzero, and interval refinement is complete: refine until it separates, as `sign_with_nonzero_certificate_over_source_box` already does. The exact 25k-bit norm is never built.
4. **Exact fallback.** Use exact local-field arithmetic only for zeros or a likely common factor. One source uses `AlgebraicField`. Two sources use a nested `LocalFieldElement` polynomial ring over the lower-degree root, reusing `predicate_vanishes_at_isolated_root` and `predicate_sign_by_isolation`.

The new path would plug into `RecursiveQuadraticValue::sign` after the existing interval and compact-witness fast paths, keeping the dense route as the final fallback until it is proven. Under a bounded predicate budget, run only the interval and modular steps.

**Measured negatives, so they are not repeated:**
- **Signing the two-radical expression in `AlgebraicField`** (exact reduced field elements, no modular step). On lazy-`Real` coefficients it moved the cost into a field gcd. On rational coefficients it took 94 s for 10 calls, against about 40 s on the dense route with modular-first filter signs. Field reduction alone does not remove the cancellation.
- **A rational interval box enclosure of P(β, x)** after the modular nonzero certificate: no gain.
- **Dyadic shortening of wide rational brackets** before the Bernstein basis change: no gain.
- **A mean-value enclosure** (exact midpoint plus a Horner bound on P′) in the coprime bisection: slower. Exact interval Horner over endpoints of about 2,000 bits inflates intermediates.

The modular step is what is missing from all of these. Implement it first, then measure.

## 2. Exact representation of generated geometry

**Fixed.** A fillet against a line used the unit direction d/|d|, so √|d|² leaked into the fillet contact's defining polynomial as lazy `Real` DAGs. The fix (cb372d03) builds the rational norm of the offset-line incidence, R² − sd²|d|²X₀², and filters candidates to the authored factor.

**Look for the same pattern elsewhere**: any generated object whose `Real` coordinates come from `sqrt` or division of algebraic projections. A strong symptom is that `format!("{:?}", real)` on a coefficient takes seconds. Candidates:
- line offsets in stroke, chamfer and bevel construction (`curve_fillet_centers.rs` `FilletOffsetCarrier2::Line` offset, `line_unit_direction`);
- concentric-arc frames;
- any `LineSeg2::translated` by a unit normal.

**Degree-214 fillet centre in `round_stroke_of_a_filleted_nurbs_pair`.**
- The fillet centre's parameter (`anchor_evidence.center_parallel`, built in `curve_fillet_centers.rs` and reconstructed through `curve_corner_chain.rs` `RetainedFilletRadialFrame2::ParallelNormal`) is a degree-214 global algebraic root of the offset-offset intersection resultant.
- It is square-free, so the degree is probably intrinsic.
- Every later kernel (`selected_parallel_normal_parallel_intersections` → selected-fiber isolation over a degree-214 field) pays for it.
- **Direction:** keep that centre as a selected fiber over the other offset's parameter, with low-degree field arithmetic, instead of publishing a global `BezierParameter2::Algebraic`. This means changing how fillet centres are authored, not adding a local fast path.

## 3. Selected-fiber common-root counting

**Where it stalls.** `filleted_boolean_miter_erosion` and `stroke_fillet_stroke` stall in `count_bivariate_fiber_system_roots`. The stuck query counts common roots of fiber polynomials of degree 36 and 40, with coefficients up to 389 bits, over a degree-14 retained field. The existing modular coprimality certificate does not decide it, so the two probably share a factor.

**Measured negative.** Sending large fibers to the reducing Euclidean chain, instead of `rational_local_subresultant_rows`, only moved the cost into `normalize_local_polynomial` field divisions.

**Ideas:**
- A modular-plus-CRT gcd over Q(α) (gcd modulo primes at α-images, then rational reconstruction verified by exact division). This is the standard cure for coefficient swell.
- A square-free, Descartes or Bernstein count of the gcd's roots in the interval, instead of a full Sturm chain.

## 4. S6 remaining sites (`promote_curve_region_bezier_parameter`)

| Status | Sites |
| --- | --- |
| Done | group A, site 5, group C sites 7, 8 and 11b |
| Deliberate cold fallbacks | cusp_overlap.rs:167 and :208, cusp_semicircle.rs:3709 |
| Group C, two-radical cut relations | sites 6 (cusp_semicircle.rs:3870) and 10 (parameters.rs:4924) |
| Group B | site 4 (parallel_kernel.rs:2820) |
| Group D, frame centres seeding fields or kernels | parameters.rs:2944, fragment.rs:1293, frames.rs:578, chord_kernel.rs:6190, rational_kernel.rs:1486, parallel_kernel.rs:1304, cusp_semicircle.rs:7387 |
| Genuinely global | site 9 (cusp_semicircle.rs:6024), site 18 (tangent.rs:1395) |

**Group C, sites 6 and 10.** These flow through `independent_diameter_sum_is_zero` and need a selected-fiber two-radical zero test (cf. `square_root_sum_sign`) threaded through four `BezierParameter2`-typed functions.

**Group B, site 4.** Widening `BezierAlgebraicCuspSemicircleParallelContact2.parallel_parameter` to `CurveParameter2` gives 32 compile errors.
- About 19 are constructors that need only `.into()`.
- About 13 are readers of Bezier-only APIs.
- Do this after moving those readers to region-parameter APIs.

**Group D.**
- These need a `parallel_normal_center_field(frame)` returning the centre's own field: a Bezier root, a selected fiber's retained parameter, or a projective scalar's denominator field extended by the speed radical.
- The selected-fiber kernels then need porting to the recursive line-kernel form. chord_kernel already owns the smaller exact construction, so start there.
- In the measured stall the centre was already a degree-214 Bezier parameter, so group D alone will not speed it up; see section 2.

## 5. S5 and S7

**S5: one comparison ladder.** Embed, then join base fields, then return `Uncertain`, with no global promotion.

**S7: collapse duplicated cusp chart variants.** The duplicated variants are `SelectedFiberRational` and `SelectedFiberParallel`, and the corresponding `*ParameterMap2` pairs: about 106 references, concentrated in `cusp_semicircle/parameters.rs`. This is structure and code size, with no performance effect.

## Fast paths added in this round

Keep these in mind when measuring:
- **Hypersolve:**
  - irreducible recursive towers (generator reuse);
  - primitive local-field remainders;
  - two-root sign by Bernstein exclusion, with a rational-norm and modular zero/nonzero certificate run before the basis change;
  - lazy centred coefficients in `algebraic_root_affine_relation`;
  - sign-change refinement for admitted roots.
- **Hypercurve:**
  - fuzzy bracket split;
  - bounded sign-change ordering;
  - exact Horner enclosure before Bernstein restriction;
  - filter-side Sturm exclusion when the defining polynomial dominates;
  - modular-first filter signs from defining degree 16 (`MODULAR_FIRST_DEFINING_DEGREE`). Below that degree the Sturm–Tarski chain is cheaper; a version without the gate regressed two passing cases by about 25%.
  - rational fillet line-offset contacts.
